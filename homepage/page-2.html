      <p>
        Jenny Oddell’s “How to Internet” article was very interesting and
        captivating to read. Looking at the Internet through a historical
        perspective was very unique as it feels like both such an old and new
        invention. There were two parts in Oddell’s article that especially
        intrigued me. First, is the transition to “the sponsored how-to”. As
        Oddell said, “what got people excited about the internet originally was
        how it allowed relatively unmediated access to regular people”. Now, a
        lot of the content we now see online is heavily mediated and sponsored.
        I was also intrigued by the Hole in Space installations in Los Angeles
        and New York back in 1980. Seeing the awe people had to this technology
        back then makes me realize that our ability to stay connected to people
        no matter the distance today is something that we take for granted.

        I enjoyed reading Laurel Schwulst’s article as well, especially with the
        various metaphors to describe the roles and functions of a website. A
        website is such a vague concept to me that seeing it through metaphors
        was definitely easier to comprehend. Though as I read the entire
        article, I was grounded by the sentence that states “Today more than
        ever, we need individuals rather than corporations to guide the web’s
        future.” Even the creator of the World Wide Web also realizes that
        capitalism’s hold on the Internet is threatening its ability to perform
        the most good. This power over the Internet must return back to
        individuals.
      </p>
      <p>Questions:</p>
      <li>
        How are individuals going to be able to regain control over the Internet
        from corporations?
      </li>
      <li>
        How can content creators balance continuing to produce sponsored content
        to gain more profit, while not disrupting the watching experience for
        the viewers?
      </li>
      <li>
        Do you believe artists should create their own space on the web? Why or
        why not?

        Laura Baladi’s essay described how archiving was used in the 2011
        Egyptian Revolution as an act of Resistance. Photography, filming,
        social media posts, and art displays later on were seen as acts of
        rebellion as they captured a significant fight against injustice,
        archiving history as it unfolded. In addition to describing how
        archiving was used during this year, Baladi also provided commentary on
        why archiving a revolution is important. Parts of the essay that
        especially stood out were how watching back clips of film agitated
        locals and showed them the need for solidarity and how artists are
        reclaiming public production of their art to reflect their revolutionary
        beliefs.

        I thoroughly enjoyed Paul Soulellis’ talk at Eyeo 2019. His thoughtful
        elaboration on how to resist normative design practices was especially
        interesting as someone who is passionate about the intersection of art
        and activism. Being introduced to strategies such as radical publishing,
        queering design, failure, and collective care was eye opening and
        comforting as it showed me a new perspective to designing. Other aspects
        of his talk that stood out to me was when he posed the questions “What
        is urgent? And urgent for whom?” and the notion that not everyone is
        able to participate in “good trouble” equally. I definitely will be
        following urgentcraft and QUEER.ARCHIVE.WORK’s work!
      </p>
      <p>Questions:</p>
      <li>
        What differentiates something simply labeled as political art from art
        as a form of activism?
      </li>
      <li>
        The 2011 Egyptian Revolution is called the “Facebook Revolution”. Does
        social media’s positive impact on politics/revolution outweigh the
        negative?
      </li>
      <li>
        How can artists be more mindful of resisting capitalist strategies when
        designing and producing?

        I appreciated how the Hello World Wide Web lecture began with the
        contextual history of how gender has historically impacted access to
        education and technology. I was completely unaware that in the 1950s
        30-50% of programmers were women and that men took over the field after
        seeing how lucrative it was – causing the decline to only 17% of
        programmers being women in 2011. Additionally, I was intrigued by the
        supplemental “How the Internet Works in 5 Minutes” video as it made me
        realize that seemingly complex concepts are easier to understand than we
        think as long as we seek the knowledge out. The drawings in the video
        made the concept especially digestible.

        Often, discussions regarding social issues are avoided in technology
        spaces. I appreciated reading Black Gooey Universe by American Artist
        because of how it seamlessly intersected these topics. Silicon Valley is
        widely known as an “incubator for the research and production of high
        technology”. Although to this day, Silicon Valley and the tech industry
        as a whole is still run by straight cis white men. This is especially
        alarming as technology once reserved for the rich and powerful are now
        more widely available to the masses. How is the tech industry supposed
        to create and develop technology to be used by a diverse group when
        those that call the shots do not share these diverse perspectives?
        Inevitably, the technology they will create will be discriminatory – as
        seen in the anti-blackness present in how GUI allowed the switch from
        black to white screens.
      </p>
      <p>
        Rich User Experience, UX and Desktopization of War also intersected the
        two issues. This article was the first time I heard the concept of
        “Desktopization of War”, but it made sense completely as the way that
        technology has made war more accessible to the masses as well as aided
        war is something I am well aware of and concerned about. The section
        that discussed the use of armed drones was especially disturbing to me.
        The gamification of war through films, video games, and new technology
        such as this has led to a higher societal acceptance of the inhumanity
        that occurs during wars. Though highly concerning, I doubt that any
        change will occur due to the hold of capitalism on the war and tech
        industries and how intertwined these two industries are.
      </p>
      <p>Questions:</p>
      <li>
        What other “technological advancements” showed the lack of diversity in
        the tech industry?
      </li>
      <li>
        Will the gamification of war in the tech industry always persist or do
        you see a path to change?

        What positive changes has the introduction of UX brought to the tech
        industry?

        Surveillance and Identity has always intrigued me. I always
        lightheartedly say that the idea of being surveilled concerns me much
        less than most people I know, because I do not have anything
        particularly to hide. However, consuming the media for this week’s
        reading made me realize how naïve of a perspective that was.
      </p>
      <p>
        Looking in Dewey-Hagborg’s project, I realized that surveillance
        required so little – even just a strand of hair or a chewed up gum I
        left behind. I also once thought that surveillance only allowed you to
        look in and inspect one’s identity. Although as Dewey-Hagborg created
        strangers’ faces through 3D printing simply from a trace of DNA, the
        gravity of surveillance seems larger and more dangerous.
      </p>
      <p>
        In Harry’s article, I was also able to get a broader view of what
        surveillance is – never really linking it to policing and other abusive
        dynamics. Understanding that surveillance is “based on a presumption of
        entitlement to access, by right or by force” allowed me to understand
        how the most marginalized in society are most affected by it. This
        realization made me see the privilege I had to not fear surveillance
        daily as a non-Black person of color and also as a documented immigrant.
      </p>
      <p>Questions:</p>
      <li>
        Alongside the technological advancements of the past decade came
        increased surveillance of consumers. Why is this seemingly increase of
        invasion of privacy seen as an advancement?
      </li>
      <li>
        Being aware of the especially oppressive history and present state
        between surveillance and the Black community, how do we responsibly
        consume media that broadcasts their trauma? Should we avoid consuming
        such media?
      </li>
      <li>
        In regards to Dewey-Hagborg’s project, does she cross an ethical line in
        her 3D printing creations despite the criticism of surveillance inherent
        in their work?
      </li>

        An Xiao Mina’s talk on Memes to Movements was very intriguing. Memes are
        considered to be more frivolous media items, but this makes them more
        accessible to the masses. Memes have the ability to make complex topics
        more digestible for anyone to understand no matter their socioeconomic
        status and/or education level. I definitely agree with how memes can
        become large parts of movements. Although, as the use of memes for
        social justice issues become more normalized, the easier it will be to
        censor – which is saddening as this used to be a strength of being able
        to use memes.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, in my home county of the Philippines, the current
        government criminalizes any act of dissent – tagging any activists as
        terrorists. With the Philippines being a country that is very active
        across all social media platforms, the government has realized that some
        activists may use social media as their main method of mobilization and
        advocacy. Therefore, they are aware to be on the lookout for these
        activists online and one might risk their life by posting political
        memes.
      </p>
      <p>Questions:</p>
      <li>
        How have memes made activism and social justice work more accessible to
        the masses?
      </li>
      <li>How does poor image build alliances and create global networks?</li>
      <li>
        Glitch art is described to be “disturbing, provoking and horrifying…
        beautifully dangerous”. What aspects of this style allow it to convey
        such an image?

        This was the first time I read about Afro-now-ism from Stephanie Dinkins
        and it was especially enlightening. The notion of having direct input
        from the public to better “infuse AI ecosystems with nuanced ideas,
        values and beliefs toward the equitable distribution of resources and
        mutually beneficial systems of governance” was something I never thought
        of before but made complete sense. The tech industry seemingly thrives
        off of barriers of access, so this made me optimistic about its future.
      </p>
      <p>
        Throughout the past years, I have read about examples of bias in machine
        learning – or the “coded gaze” as Joy Buolamwini named it. From her
        talk, I especially appreciated her call of action in the end that
        encouraged listeners to believe and practice the three tenets of “who
        codes matters”, “how we code matters”, and “why we code matters”.
        Placing these statements as central to one’s coding instead of an
        afterthought is essential for progress.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mimi Onuoha’s *69, Pathways, and Missing Datasets projects were all so
        fascinating. The central message of her talk was captured when she
        stated that “conversations about data and collection are actually just
        conversations around power and control”. I was also fascinated by the
        notion that considering the collection process itself is also as
        important as considering the data itself.
      </p>
      <p>Questions:</p>
      <li>
        How would AI ecosystems benefit from gaining direct input from the
        public?
      </li>
      <li>
        What examples of bias in machine learning have you experienced or read
        about?

      <li>
        What is the impact of seeing the value of the data collection process?

        These readings were incredibly fascinating. The intersection of
        technology and activism has always intrigued me because of technology’s
        proven large scale influence on society – both positively and
        negatively. The Cyberfeminism Index was fascinating. Seeing the long
        history of activism examples in this space was something that I was not
        aware of, but was excited to see.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ari Melenciano’s talk “Omni-Specialized Design for Beautiful Futures”
        was very informative. Hearing about her amazing work with AFROTECTOPIA,
        the “The Revolution Will Be Digitized” course, and Building a Museum 353
        Years Into The Future was empowering. The biggest takeaways were the
        idea of “Design with, not for” and the sustainable concept of circular
        design.
      </p>
      <p>
        Reading the article interviewing Hamid Khan from the Stop LAPD Spying
        Coalition was agitating. We have been exposed to similar issues of power
        imbalance and discrimination through surveillance. I admire the
        coalition’s work - all that they have accomplished and the causes they
        are continuing to fight for. Their call for abolition is the only way.
        What I learned from this article about person-based and location-based
        predictive policing definitely showed the inherent harm and
        discrimination of surveillance.
      </p>
      <p>Questions:</p>
      <li>What purpose do archives such as the Cyberfeminism Index fulfill?</li>
      <li>
        How do we implement the idea of “Design with, not for” with our work in
        class?
      </li>
      <li>
        As technology continues to advance, how do we ensure that
        discriminatory/harmful technology does not advance alongside that?
